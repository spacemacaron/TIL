``` sql

HAVING과 WHERE는 헷갈리기 쉽다 조심하도록 

 

이건 보면서 참고하려고 강의에서 가져온 소스코드 

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs;

SELECT type, SUM(calories) AS total_calories FROM exercise_logs GROUP BY type;

SELECT type, SUM(calories) AS total_calories FROM exercise_logs
    GROUP BY type
    HAVING total_calories > 150
    ;

SELECT type, AVG(calories) AS avg_calories FROM exercise_logs
    GROUP BY type
    HAVING avg_calories > 70
    ; 
    
SELECT type FROM exercise_logs GROUP BY type HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
 

 

허벌나게 뻘짓을 1시간동안했는데 그것은 AS 를 대문자로 안써서였다 이것이 프로그래밍..?
